# QHACK_2022
qhack 2022 solutions


This repository contains my solutions for the QHack tasks. I solved these tasks after the contest, and this repository serves as a showcase of my solutions.

## How to Run

To execute a solution, navigate to the specific task directory and run the following command:

```bash
python ./task_directory_name/solution.py < {input_number}.in
```

For example, to run task1 with input1, use:

```
python ./task1/solution.py < input1.in
```

## Requirements
Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Virtual Environment
It's recommended to use a virtual environment. Activate the virtual environment with:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Notes
Replace task_directory_name and solution.py with the actual task directory name and Python file name.
Adjust the input file name according to the specific test case you want to run.
Ensure the virtual environment is activated before running the code.
Feel free to explore the individual task directories for detailed task descriptions in the provided PDF files.
